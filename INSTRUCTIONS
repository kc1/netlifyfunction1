1) When running project you just run pimaBase - netlifyfunction1$ node ./public/pimaBase.js 10

2) while testing you can run dev server locally for puppetpimataxes using ; netlify dev

3)deploy with puppetPimaTaxes : netlify deploy --prod

4) One way to update from pima319 to pima325:

first go into 319 in compass and use the aggregate tab to remove all inserted table fields - probably last 8-10 (in capitals). in second stage select "$unset" then pass array like: [""] AMOUNT
"CERT NO"
"FEES"
"INTEREST"
"INTEREST DATE"
"INTERESTPERCENT"
"PAY"
"PENALTIES"
"TAX YEAR"
"TOTAL DUE"

9) check that all records have { 'TOTAL DUE': { $exists: true }} - if they don't errors will occur.

10) get the more than 1 year cases - ie have penalties.

{$and: [{'PENALTIES':{$exists:true}},{ 'PENALTIES': { $not: { $regex: /\$0\./ } }}]}

11) Next get properties with interest - sort by area

{$and: [{ 'TOTAL DUE': { $exists: true }},{ 'TOTAL DUE': { $not: { $regex: { pattern: '\\\\$0\\\\.', options: '' } } }}]}
